<h1>About Us</h1>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<h6><p>Puffin Books is a nonprofit organization that inspires a love of reading, builds community, and sparks creativity by fostering neighborhood book exchanges around the world.</p>

<br>

<p>Through Puffin Books, millions of books are exchanged each year, profoundly increasing access to books for readers of all ages and backgrounds.</p><h6>

<br>

<h3>Why Does Book Access Matter?</h3>

<h6><p>One of the most successful ways to improve the reading achievement of children is to increase their access to books, 
<br>especially at home (McGill-Franzen & Allington, 2009). But according to the U.S. Department of Education, up to 61% of low-income families do not have any books for their kids at home.</p><h6>

<br>

<h3>What We Do</h3>

<h6><p>Our staff is dedicated to increasing book access and forging community connections by helping people around the globe start and maintain Puffin Books book exchanges.</p> 

<p>We provide support to our volunteer Puffin Books stewards by providing free building instructions, online resources and ongoing support from Puffin Books staff,
<br> access to free or discounted books through our partners, and an online store that offers Library kits and pre-built Library models.</p>
 

<p>We also maintain a world map of registered Puffin Books to help people find and share books wherever they are, and we donate Puffin Books 
<br> to communities where they can make a big difference and provide access to books through our Impact Puffin Books Program.</p></h6>

<br>
<h3>Milestones and More Information</h3>

<h6><p>We were recently named a Top-Rated Nonprofit by the Great Nonprofits Organization! Discover more of our milestones and awards.</p>

<p>Puffin Books is also the recipient of the National Book Foundation’s Innovations in Reading Prize, Library Journal’s Movers and Shakers Award,
<br>the Women’s National Book Association’s Second Century Prize, and the Library of Congress Literacy Award.</p>
