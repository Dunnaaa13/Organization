<h1>About Us</h1>

<br></br>

<p>Teachers at The SKT Academy are called the Living Curriculum. Though they come in all different shapes and sizes, have varied backgrounds and experiences, and possess unique personality types, I believe certain identifiable beliefs and qualities set them apart. For example, Living Curriculum teachers are Christ-followers, relationship builders, 
effective communicators, parent partners, and student advocates.</p>

<p>Besides our exemplary teachers, The SKT Academy is also blessed with other qualities necessary to be a great school:</p>

<ul>
<li>
A modern, secure campus with state-of-the-art infrastructure supporting the latest in learning environment technology</li>
<li>An award-winning academic curriculum, including our Lower School being named to the prestigious list of Blue Ribbon Schools by the U.S. Department of Education</li>
<li>A world-class athletic facility (Payne Stewart Athletic Complex) that is home to numerous state championships</li>
<li>A vibrant, award-winning fine arts program</li>
<li>A commitment to character development and service to others</li>

<p>The SKT Academy is a great school. I invite you to experience it for yourself and your family. Please call our Office of Admissions today to schedule a campus visit. Walk the halls, sit in on a class, listen to the conversations of our students and faculty, and I believe you will recognize what makes The SKT Academy distinctive and a great school for your children and your family.</p>
</ul>

<p>In His Joy,</p>

<p>Steve D. Whitaker, Ph.D.</p>

<p>Head of School</p>
