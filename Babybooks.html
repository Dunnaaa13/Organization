<h1>In Our Community</h1>

<br>

<h6><p>SKT Academy supports and participates in community events. Some of these activities include supporting the local YMCA, PTA, Quality Care for Children, and various sponsored events. Our support further extends in the community by supporting local clubs and associations (softball, baseball, scouts, etc.).</p>

<br>

<p>SKT partners with colleges and universities by sponsoring student internships and inviting students to observe in the classrooms.</p>

<br>

<p>SKT participates in programs aimed to spread the word about quality childcare and the impact of early childhood education.</p>

<br>

<p>We enjoy visiting local HOA Community Centers for Story Time or Special Favorite Activities.   Finally, we believe in promoting our parent’s businesses through our Parent Business Directory.</p></h6>
